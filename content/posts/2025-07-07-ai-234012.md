In the evolving landscape of creativity, the rise of AI-generated art has sparked a heated debate among artists and technologists alike. As seen in the case of Halifax photographer Lauren Thomander, who uses ChatGPT to transform her images into illustrations, the question arises: is this practice ethical or simply a new tool in the artist's toolkit? While some embrace the convenience and innovation AI brings, others argue that it undermines the essence of human creativity and collaboration.

Critics like illustrator Alex MacAskill emphasize that AI's reliance on existing works without consent raises significant ethical concerns. They argue that replacing human collaboration with AI not only devalues the artistic process but also risks erasing the unique human experiences that inform art. This tension between technological advancement and artistic integrity invites us to reflect on what we truly value in creative expression.

As we navigate this complex terrain, its essential to consider the implications of AI in art. Will we prioritize convenience over authenticity, or can we find a balance that respects both innovation and the human touch? The future of art may depend on how we answer these questions.
