OpenAI is setting an ambitious timeline to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence, with CEO Sam Altman announcing plans to develop a fully automated "legitimate AI researcher" by 2028. This initiative aims to create systems capable of autonomously conducting extensive research projects, potentially surpassing human capabilities in various scientific domains.

The transition to a public benefit corporation structure allows OpenAI to pursue these goals with greater flexibility and resources. By focusing on algorithmic innovation and increasing computational power, the company believes it can achieve significant breakthroughs in AI, potentially leading to superintelligent systems within the next decade. This shift not only emphasizes the rapid advancement of AI technology but also highlights OpenAI's commitment to responsible development and scientific progress.

As we look to the future, the question remains: how will the emergence of AI researchers transform our understanding of science and technology? The next few years will be critical in shaping this new frontier of research and innovation.
