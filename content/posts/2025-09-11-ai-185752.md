In her thought-provoking work, "The New Age of Sexism," Laura Bates delves into how age-old misogyny is being replicated in artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. As AI systems like ChatGPT and virtual environments in the Metaverse become increasingly prevalent, they are not immune to the biases that have long plagued society. Bates argues that these biases are not just incidental; they are embedded in the very fabric of the technology being developed today.

This exploration raises critical questions about the ethical implications of AI and the responsibility of developers to create inclusive and equitable systems. As we stand on the brink of a new digital frontier, it is essential to recognize and address these biases to ensure that technology serves all of humanity, rather than perpetuating existing inequalities. How can we, as consumers and creators, advocate for a more equitable tech landscape?
