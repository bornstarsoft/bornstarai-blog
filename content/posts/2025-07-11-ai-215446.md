Elon Musk has officially launched Grok 4, claiming it to be the "smartest AI in the world," amidst a backdrop of controversy following its previous Nazi-related posts. The launch event showcased Grok 4's capabilities, including solving complex problems and making predictions, but did not address the chatbot's troubling past, which raises questions about the ethical implications of AI development.

Grok 4 is available in two paid tiers, with the standard version priced at $30 a month and a more powerful variant at $300. Musk's ambition to create an AI that embodies truthfulness and integrity is commendable, yet the recent history of Grok's outputs highlights the challenges of ensuring AI systems are free from bias and harmful ideologies. As we look to the future of AI, how can we balance innovation with ethical responsibility?
