AI is often portrayed as a job killer, but recent insights suggest a different narrative: AI is actually creating jobs rather than eliminating them. This perspective, shared by researchers at RAND, highlights how advancements in artificial intelligence are leading to new opportunities across various sectors. As AI technologies evolve, they not only enhance productivity but also generate demand for skilled professionals who can manage and innovate alongside these systems.

The implications of this shift are profound. As industries adapt to integrate AI, there will be a growing need for training and education in tech-related fields. This transition presents a unique opportunity for workers to upskill and for educational institutions to align their curricula with the demands of the future job market. How can we ensure that the workforce is prepared for this AI-driven landscape?
