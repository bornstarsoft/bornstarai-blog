The 2026 Taipei International Game Show showcased an impressive booth for "Dolls Frontline 2: Exilium," attracting a vibrant crowd of fans and cosplayers. This event highlighted the engaging intersection of gaming and cosplay culture, where players could immerse themselves in the world of Dolflo 2 while interacting with stunning representations of their favorite characters.

At the booth, attendees enjoyed a unique memory puzzle game that rewarded players based on their commander level in the app. The atmosphere was electric, with cosplayers embodying characters like Macchiato and Mayuzumi Smoke, creating a lively environment for photo opportunities. The combination of cute and cool character designs, especially with characters like Suomi and Kunkai in their stylish swimsuits, left fans enchanted and eager for more.

As we reflect on the success of the Dolflo 2 booth, its clear that events like the Taipei Game Show not only celebrate gaming but also foster community through cosplay. What will the next big gaming event bring to the table in terms of innovation and fan engagement?
