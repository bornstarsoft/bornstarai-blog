In a significant move towards a more equitable digital landscape, UN Member States have pledged to prioritize a people-first approach to digital technologies and strengthen safeguards around artificial intelligence (AI). This commitment emerged from the recent World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS+20), which highlighted the urgent need to address the widening digital divide and ensure that technological advancements serve humanity's best interests.

The discussions underscored that simply getting people online is no longer sufficient; the focus must shift towards responsible governance of emerging technologies. With the internet becoming essential for services like telemedicine and online education, the call for greater investment in digital infrastructure and skills is more critical than ever, especially in developing countries where access remains limited.

As we look ahead, the establishment of an Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and a Global Dialogue on AI Governance in 2026 could pave the way for a more inclusive and trustworthy digital future. How can we, as individuals and communities, contribute to shaping this vision of a more equitable digital world?
