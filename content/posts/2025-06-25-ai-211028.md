The traditional résumé is facing an existential crisis, and artificial intelligence is at the heart of this transformation. With a staggering 11,000 job applications processed by LinkedIn every minute, employers are overwhelmed by a flood of AI-generated submissions, leading to what some are calling "hiring slop." This phenomenon not only complicates the hiring process but also raises questions about the future relevance of résumés as a meaningful indicator of a candidate's qualifications and interest.

As AI tools become increasingly sophisticated, candidates can now generate hundreds of tailored applications with minimal effort, turning the job search into a numbers game. This shift has prompted companies to deploy their own AI defenses, resulting in an escalating arms race where machines are pitted against each other. Ironically, while AI aims to streamline hiring, it may be creating more noise than clarity, making it harder for genuine candidates to stand out.

The implications of this trend are profound. As the résumé loses its significance, we may need to explore alternative evaluation methods that emphasize real skills and capabilities, such as live problem-solving sessions or portfolio reviews. The question remains: can we find a way to bridge the gap between technology and authentic human connection in the hiring process?
