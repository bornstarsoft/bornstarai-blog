As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly prevalent in academic settings, a pressing question arises: are students sacrificing their own agency to these technologies? A recent initiative by a professor at Angelo State University aimed to uncover whether students were relying on AI for their assignments, shedding light on a critical issue in modern education.

Will Teague, the professor behind this investigation, emphasizes the importance of maintaining personal agency in learning. While AI can enhance research and writing processes, it also poses risks of dependency, potentially undermining the development of critical thinking and creativity among students. This dilemma is not just about the tools themselves but about how they reshape the educational landscape and student experiences.

As we navigate this evolving relationship with AI, its essential to reflect on how these tools can be used responsibly. Are we equipping students with the skills they need to thrive in a tech-driven world, or are we inadvertently hindering their growth? The conversation around AI in education is just beginning, and its one that deserves our attention.
