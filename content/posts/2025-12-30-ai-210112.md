China is taking significant steps to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) with new rules aimed at protecting children and preventing harmful advice from chatbots. The proposed regulations by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) highlight the urgent need for safety measures in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, particularly as chatbots gain popularity for companionship and therapy.

Under these draft rules, AI developers will be required to implement personalized settings, enforce time limits on usage, and obtain parental consent for emotional support services. Most notably, chatbot operators must ensure that any conversation related to self-harm is immediately escalated to a human operator, who will then notify a guardian or emergency contact. This proactive approach underscores the importance of mental health in the digital age, especially for vulnerable users.

As AI technology continues to advance, these regulations represent a crucial step toward ensuring that innovation does not come at the expense of safety. With the rise of AI applications in China, how will these regulations shape the future of technology and its impact on society?
