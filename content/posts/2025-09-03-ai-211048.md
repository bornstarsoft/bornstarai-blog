For years, Tesla's Dojo was heralded as the key to unlocking full self-driving capabilities and advancing AI technology within the automotive industry. However, the recent decision to shut down Dojo and disband its team marks a significant pivot in Tesla's strategy, raising questions about the future of its AI ambitions. Elon Musk's vision of Tesla as an AI company has faced scrutiny, especially as the company shifts focus towards partnerships for chip development rather than relying solely on its in-house solutions.

The closure of Dojo not only signifies the end of a highly anticipated project but also highlights the challenges of developing cutting-edge technology in a rapidly evolving market. As Tesla moves forward with its new AI6 chips and the Cortex supercluster, one cant help but wonder: what does this mean for the future of AI in automotive technology? Will Tesla's new direction lead to the breakthroughs Musk has promised, or is it a sign of deeper issues within the companys ambitious plans?
