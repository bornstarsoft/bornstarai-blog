Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the landscape of scientific research, offering individual scientists unprecedented tools to advance their careers. However, a recent study indicates that while AI enhances personal productivity, it may inadvertently narrow the scope of scientific inquiry, limiting the exploration of critical global challenges.

Researchers, including James Evans from the University of Chicago, have found that AI tools enable scientists to publish more papers and gain more citations, which is beneficial for their careers. Yet, this reliance on AI often leads to a focus on safer, well-trodden topics, potentially stifling innovation in areas like climate change and public health. The study highlights a concerning trend: as more scientists turn to AI for guidance, the diversity of research topics diminishes, creating a public goods problem in science.

As we navigate this complex relationship between AI and scientific discovery, it's essential to ask ourselves: how can we leverage AI's capabilities while ensuring that we continue to tackle the most pressing issues of our time? The future of science may depend on our ability to balance these two forces effectively.
