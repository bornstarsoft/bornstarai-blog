President Lee Jae-myung has made a compelling case for artificial intelligence (AI) as a cornerstone of national power and security. During his recent visit to the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), he emphasized the need for South Korea to invest significantly in AI technology and cultivate a workforce of experts to harness its potential across various sectors, including defense, healthcare, and industry.

Lee's remarks come at a time when nations worldwide are recognizing AI as a critical driver of economic growth and security. With plans to invest over $2 billion in AI research and development by 2025, South Korea aims to position itself as a global leader in this transformative technology. The call for collaboration among government, industry, and academia underscores the urgency of fostering a robust AI ecosystem.

As we stand on the brink of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the question remains: how can countries effectively leverage AI to enhance their national security and economic resilience? The future of AI is not just about technology; it's about the strategic choices we make today.
