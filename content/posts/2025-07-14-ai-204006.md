In late 2023, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, introduced a groundbreaking concept: sovereign AI. This idea proposes that each country should develop its own AI system, tailored to its unique data and values, utilizing local infrastructure. By framing these systems as "AI factories," Huang appeals to governments' interests in domestic manufacturing and technological independence.

The notion of sovereign AI could revolutionize how nations approach artificial intelligence, potentially leading to a more personalized and ethically aligned technology landscape. As countries invest in their own AI capabilities, the implications for global tech dynamics and international collaboration could be profound. Will we see a new era of AI that respects national values and priorities?
