The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is creating a stark divide between the U.S. and China, leaving many countries at risk of technological vassalage. With these two nations controlling 70% of the worlds top machine learning researchers and 90% of global computing power, the implications for middle powers like India, France, and the United Kingdom are profound. They face a precarious situation where their access to cutting-edge AI capabilities is dictated by the policies of Washington and Beijing, potentially locking them out of the benefits of this transformative technology.

Middle powers are currently reliant on foreign AI systems, which poses significant risks as these capabilities cannot be stockpiled like traditional goods. As AI becomes more integrated into critical infrastructure, the stakes will only rise. Countries must find ways to build their own capabilities or negotiate favorable terms with the tech giants of the U.S. and China. The future may involve a strategic balancing act, where these nations must leverage their unique positions to secure their technological futures.

As we look ahead, the question remains: how will middle powers navigate this complex landscape to ensure they are not left behind in the AI revolution? The choices they make today will shape their roles in the global economy of tomorrow.
