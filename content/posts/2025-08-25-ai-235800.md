ScotRail's recent decision to replace its controversial AI voice, Iona, highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the ethical use of artificial intelligence in public services. Initially introduced to enhance accessibility, the AI voice faced backlash from both a professional voiceover artist and passengers who found it to be unnatural and unsettling. This situation raises critical questions about consent and the implications of using AI to replicate human voices without proper authorization.

The voice of Gayanne Potter, whose Scottish accent was used to train Iona, has become a focal point in this discussion. Potter expressed her discontent over her voice being used as an AI clone without her consent, emphasizing the challenges faced by creative professionals in an increasingly automated world. As ScotRail works towards implementing an alternative voice, the situation serves as a reminder of the importance of ethical considerations in AI development.

As we look to the future, how can organizations ensure that AI technologies are used responsibly and transparently? The ScotRail case may be just the tip of the iceberg in a broader conversation about the role of AI in our daily lives and the need for ethical frameworks to guide its development.
