As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, the question on many minds is whether AI will replace human musicians. Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of the Recording Academy, expresses a dual sentiment of optimism and fear regarding AI's impact on the music industry. In a recent interview, he shared insights on how AI technology could transform music creation while also posing challenges to traditional musicianship.

Mason highlights the potential for AI to enhance creativity and streamline production processes, allowing artists to explore new soundscapes and innovate in ways previously unimaginable. However, he also acknowledges the risks that come with this technology, particularly the threat it poses to the livelihoods of human musicians.
