Governor JB Pritzker's recent signing of two significant bills highlights a growing concern over rogue towing companies and the use of artificial intelligence in mental health therapy. The first law aims to protect consumers from unscrupulous tow truck operators who have exploited loopholes to continue their illegal practices. By empowering state police to impound vehicles and revoke licenses for unpaid fines, Illinois is taking a firm stand against these predatory practices.

The second law, which bans AI from acting as therapists, raises important questions about the role of technology in mental health care. While AI can offer innovative solutions, the decision to restrict its use in therapy underscores the need for human empathy and understanding in mental health treatment. As we navigate these changes, it will be crucial to find a balance between leveraging technology and ensuring quality care.

As we look to the future, how will these laws shape the landscape of consumer protection and mental health services in Illinois and beyond?
