The inaugural day of India's AI Impact Summit, touted as a significant international gathering in the Global South, was marred by logistical issues that overshadowed its potential. Attendees faced long queues, overcrowding, and confusion at the venue, Bharat Mandapam, leading to frustration among delegates and exhibitors alike. Reports of stolen products and inadequate food and water access further compounded the disarray, raising questions about the event's organization.

Despite the chaos, the summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aims to explore the dual nature of AI's impact on society. With participation from over 100 countries and notable figures like Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai, the event is positioned as a platform for showcasing India's technological prowess. However, the operational lapses on the first day risk overshadowing the substantive discussions intended to take place.

As the summit continues, it remains to be seen whether the organizers can address these issues effectively and provide a conducive environment for meaningful dialogue about AI's future. Will the lessons learned from this experience pave the way for better management in future tech events?
