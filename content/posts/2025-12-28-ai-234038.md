The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is reshaping the job market in ways we never anticipated. In a poignant reflection, Brian Groh shares his personal experience of losing his copywriting job to AI and finding unexpected solace in tree cutting. This narrative highlights a critical insight: as technology evolves, so must our understanding of work and value in society.

Groh's journey from a comfortable freelance career to the physically demanding world of tree work underscores the harsh reality many face today. The irony of seeking career advice from the very technology that replaced him speaks volumes about the unpredictable nature of modern employment. It raises important questions about the future of work and how we can adapt to an ever-changing landscape.

As we navigate this new era, its essential to reflect on our skills and how they align with market demands. Will we embrace change and find new ways to contribute, or will we cling to outdated notions of work? The future is uncertain, but one thing is clear: adaptability will be key in a world increasingly influenced by AI.
