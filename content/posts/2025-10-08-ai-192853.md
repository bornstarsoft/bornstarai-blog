The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) is being likened to the Industrial Revolution, a comparison that resonates deeply in today's tech-driven society. This connection is the central theme of the new opera "The Last Machine Breaker" by composer Ben Crick, which explores the societal impacts of technological advancements across two distinct timelines: 1813 and 2030. By juxtaposing these eras, Crick invites us to reflect on how history can inform our understanding of modern challenges.

As we witness rapid technological changes, much like those experienced in the early 1800s, questions arise about the future of work and the fate of individuals displaced by automation. The opera's setting in West Yorkshire, a historical hub of industrial strife, serves as a poignant reminder of the struggles faced by communities during periods of significant change. Crick emphasizes the importance of learning from the past to navigate the complexities of our current landscape.

As we stand on the brink of a new era defined by AI, we must ask ourselves: How can we ensure that the benefits of technology are shared equitably, and what lessons from history can guide us in creating a more inclusive future?
