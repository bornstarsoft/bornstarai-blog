Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally reshaping the landscape of university assessments, presenting what experts are calling a "wicked problem." As generative AI tools like ChatGPT become more sophisticated, students can produce essays and answers in mere seconds, leaving educational institutions grappling with how to maintain academic integrity while adapting to this rapid technological evolution.

Our recent research highlights that the challenges posed by AI in assessments are not just about finding a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, they require a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs involved. For instance, while making assessments more resistant to AI might enhance integrity, it could also stifle creativity and critical thinking among students. This ongoing tension underscores the need for flexible and transparent processes in assessment design.

As we navigate this complex landscape, it's crucial for educators and institutions to acknowledge the inherent messiness of the problem. By shifting the focus from seeking definitive solutions to fostering an environment of continuous negotiation and adaptation, we can better support teachers and students alike. How can we collectively embrace this challenge to ensure that the value of a university degree remains intact in the age of AI?
