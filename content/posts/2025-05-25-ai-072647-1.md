At Google I/O 2025, the tech giant unveiled a groundbreaking feature that could redefine online shopping: the "Try it on" AI tool. This innovative addition to Google Shopping allows users to upload a photo of themselves and virtually try on clothes, bridging the gap between online and in-store shopping experiences. While the technology is impressive, it also raises questions about accuracy and user experience.

Using the "Try it on" feature is straightforward. After signing into your Google account and enabling the experiment, you can upload a full-body photo and start trying on various outfits. The AI, trained specifically for fashion, does a commendable job of simulating how clothes would fit and look on you. However, the experience isn't without its quirks—like unexpected accessories or alterations that might leave you scratching your head. 

As we embrace this new era of AI-driven shopping, it’s essential to consider both the potential and the pitfalls of such technology. Will this tool revolutionize the way we shop online, or will it remain a novelty that users quickly tire of? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: the future of fashion retail is evolving rapidly.
