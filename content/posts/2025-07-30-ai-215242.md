OpenAI's new study mode for ChatGPT aims to enhance student engagement by employing the Socratic method, yet it raises concerns about the potential for students to bypass genuine learning. By encouraging users to think critically and respond to open-ended questions, this feature attempts to transform ChatGPT from a mere answer machine into a more interactive tutor.

However, the challenge remains: with the ease of switching back to direct answers, will students truly engage with the material, or will they succumb to the temptation of quick fixes? The implications of relying on AI for educational support are profound, especially for younger learners still developing critical thinking skills.

As we navigate this new landscape, its essential to consider how tools like ChatGPT can be used effectively in education. Will students embrace the challenge of deeper learning, or will they find shortcuts that undermine their educational journey? The future of learning may depend on our ability to strike this balance.
